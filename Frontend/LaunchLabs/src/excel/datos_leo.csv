23613,Packaged Food Mass Reduction Technology Development (PI=Leong),"The Advanced Food Technology (AFT) project seeks to define a safe, palatable, and nutritious food system to support long duration space missions beyond Low Earth Orbit (LEO). Balancing resources such as water, food preparation time, stowage volume, launch mass, and power requirements is central to defining a functioning food system solution for these missions. Prior AFT work has addressed the need to decrease the mass of the food system, and has recommended means such as reducing the moisture of the food system, increasing the nutrient density of the food system, and streamlining food packaging systems to accomplish this. Building on these recommendations, the objective of this project is therefore to identify technologies required to formulate meal replacement options that would decrease the mass and volume of the food system, as well as decrease the crew time associated with meal preparation. As commercially available meal replacement products are not adequate for NASA needs, this project will proceed by formulating new products that meet the unique requirements of spaceflight beyond LEO. The development of meal replacement options for the packaged space food system will be achieved by:  * Aligning previous studies on nutrition and mass savings to compile the nutritional requirements and consumption guidelines for meal replacement beverages and bars.  * Developing meal replacement bar(s) meeting nutrition, sensory, and shelf life requirements for space food systems.  * Developing meal replacement beverage(s) meeting nutrition, sensory, and shelf life requirements for space food systems.  * Assessing the meal replacement system and creating an implementation plan for the meal replacement options.  Some accommodations have been made in the product development design to ensure that the project is completed within budget and on schedule. The recipe development of the bars and beverages will baseline from existing commercial bars and beverages rather than starting from new formulas even though significant changes are likely required to meet nutritional needs. Researchers will leverage flavor concepts from existing commercial bar and beverage products. Accelerated shelf life testing will done to assess stability as the project duration is shorter than the desired shelf life. While the ideal sensory evaluation would be a repeated exposure test to ensure acceptability levels were sustained over multiple experiences, the product amounts and the availability of panelists requires a one-time sensory evaluation for each product. Upon the completion of this study, an assessment of representative formulated meal replacement options will be provided to stakeholders, in order to offer an understanding of meal replacement technology and associated mass savings.",Human Research Program,"TX06.3.5 - Food Production, Processing, and Preservation",02/09/2024 16:09,Packaged Food Mass Reduction Technology Development (PI=Leong) (https://techport.nasa.gov/view/23613),https://techport.nasa.gov/api/projects/23613,

The film-evaporation MEMS tunable array (FEMTA) concept utilizes a green propellant and microscale effects in fluid surface tension and advanced MEMS microfabrication to achieve thrust under 0.1 W of power and within 0.1 U total system volume. Interplanetary CubeSats can utilize FEMTA for high slew rate attitude corrections in addition to desaturating reaction wheels. The FEMTA in cooling mode can be used for thermal control during high-power communication events, which are likely to accompany the attitude correction.",Small Spacecraft Technology,TX17.3.4 - Control Force and Torque Actuators,02/06/2024 17:18,MEMS Reaction Control and Maneuvering for Picosats beyond LEO (https://techport.nasa.gov/view/91591),https://techport.nasa.gov/api/projects/91591,
125603,LEO Manufacturing of 3D Printed Covetic Nanomaterials for Advanced Electronics,"An on-demand direct metal printing technology will be developed that can utilize the unique advantages of manufacturing in a zero-gravity Low Earth Orbit (LEO) environment, to produce value-added next generation materials that are challenging to manufacture terrestrially. One such class of materials, covetics (nanocarbon-infused metals), are inherently difficult to produce on Earth but have great in-space and terrestrial commercial potential due to their enhanced physicochemical properties, such as higher thermal/electrical conductivity and higher strength at lower mass as compared to conventional wrought metals. This program will develop the technical capabilities of the direct print method and module to print covetic materials on-demand in an LEO environment with the desired material property enhancements. Alignment with NASA and commercial space needs, and acceleration of integration of the technology into NASA’s mission, will be done by designing and building a direct print module and method can be incorporated into nScrypt’s multi-module platform, for subsequent demonstration in a parabolic loop zero-gravity flight test. (Note: the nScrypt multi-module system is the same that NASA’s On-Demand Manufacturing of Electronics group is installing on the International Space Station in FY2024). A successful demonstration of the direct print method and module’s viability through the zero-gravity flight test will align the covetic manufacturing technology with space approved hardware and reduce the entry barrier toward LEO demonstration in Phase IIE/III. Finally, the commercial viability will be established by outreach to the communities interested in covetic material properties and by identifying a pathway to system scale and implementation on commercial space platforms. As the market value is validated and technical method is demonstrated on International Space Station, we will work with commercial space companies (Axiom Space) to scale and transition the technology.",Small Business Innovation Research/Small Business Tech Transfer,TX12.4.1 - Manufacturing Processes,01/10/2024 16:55,LEO Manufacturing of 3D Printed Covetic Nanomaterials for Advanced Electronics (https://techport.nasa.gov/view/125603),https://techport.nasa.gov/api/projects/125603,
113187,Efficient and Secure Communications for Spacecraft Beyond LEO,"Communications and navigation among distributed spacecraft and between spacecraft and the Earth become quite challenging beyond Low Earth Orbit distances. Additionally, new classes of missions may require assets that are able to regularly coordinate among themselves with minimal ground intervention in order to achieve complex mission objectives. Antara’s proposed effort will apply an Evolutionary Strategy to R&amp;D and evolve the functional and performance capabilities of Antara’s current technology to enable scalable, efficient, and cyber-secure collaborative communications for widely distributed SmallSat that will operate far into the near-Earth region of space and beyond into deep space. Antara’s cross-cutting communication software will be compatible with existing and planned NASA architecture (e.g., Scan and LunaNet), the Internal Communication System Interoperability Standards (ICSIS), applicable CCSDS books and will support the lunar communications architecture, as described in IOAG’s evolving “The Future Lunar Communications Architecture.” The proposed technology will enable coordination among multiple lunar surface and orbiting users and provide data relay from lunar surface to surface as well as data relay to earth with high integrity, provenance and confidentiality. The innovation is directly relevant to NASA TA 4.5.4, 5.3.1, 5.3.3, and 11.4.8 and will support and advance the lunar communications architecture and the Moon to Mars Campaign. The resulting flight demonstration ready software will be compatible with existing NASA space communications infrastructure, frequency spectrum allocations, and applicable standards. Antara’s overall deliverables and artifacts will achieve sufficient maturity and include appropriate documentation to allow it to be instantiated, configured, and tested with potential NASA missions and be considered as a payload for flight demonstration.",Small Business Innovation Research/Small Business Tech Transfer,TX08.1.5 - Lasers,01/10/2024 16:54,Efficient and Secure Communications for Spacecraft Beyond LEO (https://techport.nasa.gov/view/113187),https://techport.nasa.gov/api/projects/113187,
113316,LEO Manufacturing of 3D Printed Covetic Nanomaterials for Advanced Electronics,"This program will develop an in-space material manufacturing approach to leverage the unique capabilities of the International Space Station. Specifically, one such, exemplar novel class of material, covetics (nano-carbon-infused metals), are inherently challenging to produce terrestrially but have great commercial potential due to their enhanced physicochemical properties as compared to conventional metals, such as high thermal (50% higher than Cu), high electrical conductivity (40% higher than 6061 Al), and high strength (30% higher yield strength than Cu). Therefore, Faraday Technology and the University of Texas in Dallas will develop a material manufacturing process to directly print these next generation covetic materials in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) via an electro-codeposition approach. This work will build on the University of Texas's direct Cu printing platform which has been demonstrated at pre-commercial scale the potential to print large area circuit board lines utilizing a localized pulse electrodeposited (L-PED) technique. Additionally, this work will build on Faraday’s electro-codeposition process activities that include depositing carbon materials into copper. In Phase I we will establish the viability of directly printing covetic materials by developing the direct write hardware and the electro-codeposition electrolytes to deposit electrochemically reduced carbon materials into a copper matrix in an orientation opposite or perpendicular to gravity such that we can demonstrate at the lab scale, the potential to form covetic materials with enhanced electrical, thermal, and mechanical properties. This demonstration would enable a preliminary market need assessment (Phase I) and zero gravity flight demonstration (Phase II), which could establish a commercial market for in-space manufacturing of these exciting covetic materials.

103121,Towards a Turn-Key Graphical Programming Suite for Autonomous Robotic Manufacturing and Teleoperation of Remote Robotic Assets,"NASA has long term goals of autonomous habitat construction, vehicle repair, and human-robot teams for space exploration. More immediately, NASA has multiple dual-armed manipulators onboard the ISS, in R2 and Dextre. To facilitate NASA's needs, TRACLabs has created the CRAFTSMAN software toolkit for improved control and teleoperation of robotic manipulators. This software improves the state of the art by focusing on 3D user interfaces for commanding, on advanced task programming for robots to better interact with the world, and on smooth Cartesian trajectories needed for manipulation and tool usage.The technologies in CRAFTSMAN are also directly applicable to the domain of flexible manufacturing. Our investor, Magna International, is one of the top automotive parts suppliers in the world, and is extremely interested in improving the efficiency and quality of their plants through improvements to their automation capabilities. While they are already a customer of the CRAFTSMAN product, they would like to see this product improved before extending its use beyond custom, high-cost, low production use cases. By both integrating improved path planning capabilities and cooperative multi-arm coordination into the CRAFTSMAN software suite, we can increase the usability of CRAFTSMAN by non-expert users, while also increasing the use cases in the manufacturing domain. By integrating these two technologies, we expect CRAFTSMAN to be at TRL 7, which would help increase our customer base, while providing NASA with software directly applicable to its current and future robotics assets.",Small Business Innovation Research/Small Business Tech Transfer,TX07.2.3 - Surface Construction and Assembly,01/10/2024 16:54,Towards a Turn-Key Graphical Programming Suite for Autonomous Robotic Manufacturing and Teleoperation of Remote Robotic Assets (https://techport.nasa.gov/view/103121),https://techport.nasa.gov/api/projects/103121,
102040,Hosted Communications Payload to Leverage Commercial LEO Constellations,"A number of satellite communications (SATCOM) constellations have recently been proposed. Because some are funded to initial deployment, it is likely that opportunities to host NASA payloads on these commercial constellations will soon appear. If a tactical communications payload can be hosted by these constellations, the constellation infrastructure can be leveraged as a backbone for tactical communications. These constellations therefore offer the opportunity to provide increased resilience of communications links by delivering diversity of communications coverage and/or dramatically increased tactical communications capacity which can be made available on demand. The SATCOM constellations of most interest are Low Earth Orbit (LEO) and Medium Earth Orbit (MEO) because they have the lowest launch and operations costs, have best coverage (they contain many satellites), and best link budgets. However, such orbits add complexity to the hosted tactical communications payload design and operation, since the satellite will pass over a user terminal which may not have the ability to track the satellite with its antenna.",Small Business Innovation Research/Small Business Tech Transfer,TX05.1.6 - Optimetrics,01/10/2024 16:54,Hosted Communications Payload to Leverage Commercial LEO Constellations (https://techport.nasa.gov/view/102040),https://techport.nasa.gov/api/projects/102040,

17758,CubeSat Ambipolar Thruster for LEO and Deep Space Missions,"Aether Industries proposes the development of a novel, primary plasma propulsion system that is well suited for small spacecraft. This technology, called the CubeSat Ambipolar Thruster (CAT), would provide CubeSats and other micro- and nano-satellites with the propulsive capability to make meaningful orbital plane and altitude changes — capability that does not currently exist with state-of-the-art micropropulsion technologies. As such, the CAT engine is an enabling technology that supports NASA, commercial, university, and military CubeSat needs from constellation deployment to lunar orbit insertion and beyond. In the CAT engine, a high-power RF plasma discharge is expanded adiabatically along a magnetic nozzle topology established by permanent magnets. A resultant ambipolar electric field accelerates the ions to high energies to generate thrust while retaining high propellant utilization. The CAT engine offers a means of providing efficient and high thrust-to-power primary propulsion for CubeSats and microsatellites. The CAT engine promises to change the CubeSat paradigm from passive sensor carriers to fully capable mission-completing spacecraft. Successful implementation by our team will result in the transition of technology developed into the commercial sector by a small business, the engagement of the next generation of the space sector workforce, and the infusion of an advanced in-space propulsion technology for future NASA, commercial, and government missions.",Small Business Innovation Research/Small Business Tech Transfer,TX01.2.2 - Electrostatic Propulsion,01/10/2024 16:52,CubeSat Ambipolar Thruster for LEO and Deep Space Missions (https://techport.nasa.gov/view/17758),https://techport.nasa.gov/api/projects/17758,
17751,Natural Touch Interaction for Virtual Reality and Teleoperation via Ungrounded Tactile Shear Feedback,"The proposed research innovation will create a low-cost, intuitive means for people to have multi-fingered interaction with Robonaut 2 and training simulations via tactile shear feedback. This work builds on the PI's prior university research. Tactile shear feedback imparts friction and shear forces to the user's hand via sliding plates that are built into the handle of the grasped device. These sliding plates rub against the user's skin and induce in-hand friction forces to create perceived force/torque-like sensations despite not being connected to a fixed surface. Translational motions and forces can be portrayed along the length of the handle by moving the sliding plates in unison in the corresponding direction; whereas moving the plates at opposing locations in the handle in opposite directions creates the feeling of the device's handle wrenching within the user's grasp. To this novel form of haptic feedback, the PI proposes to add a more intuitive means for a user to interact with virtual and teleoperated environments by allowing the user to open and close his/her grasp as he/she would naturally do when grasping an object. It is hypothesized that adding the ability for the user to interact by opening and closing his/her grasp will provide improved interaction performance and be preferred by users. The proposed work also creates the ability to individually control the fingers on multi-fingered robot hands like those on Robonaut 2. Our developed haptic interface will provide a low-cost means for mission scientists, astronauts, and others to interact with Robonaut 2. The developed interface will also provide greater access for planning and training of EVAs, and could provide a more intuitive interface for ground personnel to operate and supervise robots. Furthermore, the developed system's low cost would also permit it to be used directly in NASA outreach / STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, &amp; Math) activities.",Small Business Innovation Research/Small Business Tech Transfer,TX04.3.2 - Grappling Technologies,01/10/2024 16:52,Natural Touch Interaction for Virtual Reality and Teleoperation via Ungrounded Tactile Shear Feedback (https://techport.nasa.gov/view/17751),https://techport.nasa.gov/api/projects/17751,
95868,Terabyte Infrared Delivery 200Gb/sec Laser Communications System for LEO Direct-to-Earth Missions,"Satellites in low-Earth orbit (LEO) have on-board sensors that can generate large amounts of data to be delivered to a ground user. Direct-to-Earth delivery from LEO is challenging because of the sparse contact with a ground terminal, but the short link distances involved can enable very high data rates by exploiting the abundance of spectrum available at optical frequencies. NASA's Terabyte Infrared Delivery (TBIRD) program will demonstrate a direct-to-Earth laser communication link from a small satellite platform to a small ground terminal at burst rates up to 200 Gbps. Such a link is capable of transferring several terabytes per day to a single ground terminal. The high burst rates are achieved by leveraging off-the-shelf fiber-telecommunications transceivers for use in space applications. A 2U TBIRD payload is currently being developed for flight on a 6U NASA CubeSat.&nbsp; The relatively short distance (~ 1000 km) and corresponding reduced range loss of a direct-to-Earth (DTE) LEO laser link offers an opportunity to provide extremely high bandwidth downlinks at very low cost, size, weight, and power (SWaP). Under NASA SCaN support, MIT Lincoln Laboratory is developing the TeraByte InfraRed Delivery (TBIRD) terminal [6,7] to demonstrate a 200 Gbps downlink using only 1.8U x 1U x 1U volume (1U=10 cm) and less than 2.25 kg. The two baseline 100 Gbps modems are variants of a highly-integrated COTS design that was modified to be space-qualified; current efforts are now focused on the on-board 2.0 terabyte (TB) memory and controller which must be read at similar data rates. A demonstration flight is planned on the NASA Space Technology Mission Directorate (STMD) Pathfinder 3 CubeSat in late 2020 and it is expected to demonstrate downloads of the entire 2.0 TB data buffer on a single pass. While the initial demonstration will use existing NASA optical ground stations with adaptive optics (AO), there are plans to develop low-cost optical ground stations to support such rates to be specifically co-located at mission data storage facilities or even commercial data centres to reduce the cost of ground-based fiber backhaul at such data rates. &nbsp;",Space Communications and Navigation,TX05.1.6 - Optimetrics,05/10/2021 18:37,Terabyte Infrared Delivery 200Gb/sec Laser Communications System for LEO Direct-to-Earth Missions (https://techport.nasa.gov/view/95868),https://techport.nasa.gov/api/projects/95868,

95773,Extension of the dE/dx-E Technique Using Silicon Detectors to below 1 MeV/nucleon,"The ""2012 Solar and Space Physics Decadal Survey"" and the ""2014 Heliophysics Roadmap"" acknowledged the importance of better understanding how ions and electrons are accelerated to high energies in the solar corona, the interplanetary medium, and the local galactic medium. Over the past two decades, missions such as ACE and Wind have shown that the existence of a seed population of suprathermal particles plays a central role in the efficient acceleration of high-energy particles. Thus, it is important to understand the mechanisms that produce and maintain the suprathermal particle distribution and accelerate a fraction of it to much higher energies. We propose the development of a sensor that would make possible instruments that can span the ion energy range from &lt;0.5 MeV/nuc to several MeV/nuc with high efficiency and thereby address these objectives. Stacks of silicon solid-state detectors have been widely used since early in the space age for making measurements of energetic particles. By combining the energy loss, Delta-E, from a detector that the particle penetrates with the residual energy, E', in following detectors, the total energy, the nuclear charge, and, in some cases, the mass of the particle can be derived. The lower limit to which this technique can be applied is set by the thickness of the first detector, which the particle must penetrate. Until very recently, silicon detectors with good thickness uniformity have only been available in thicknesses down ~30 microns, which sets a lower energy limit of several MeV/nucleon. Over a number of years, we have developed a new technique for fabricating thin silicon detectors that leads to devices that can be significantly thinner, much more uniform in thickness, and mechanically more robust than earlier detectors. Detectors of this new type are being flown in thicknesses of 12 microns and 25 microns in the EPI-Hi instrument on the Parker Solar Probe mission. We have worked with a commercial detector manufacturer to transition the fabrication process to an industrial setting, thus making this type of detector available to the broader scientific community. The detector fabrication process is thought to be suitable for making devices that are thinner than the 12-micron detectors used in EPI-Hi. We propose the fabrication and testing of prototype detectors with thicknesses down to ~5 microns, which would lower the threshold for the Delta-E vs E' technique using silicon detectors to ~0.4 MeV/nucleon. To optimize the performance of such devices, we will also investigate the use of thinner dead layers, which can be made by low-energy ion implantation, and the use of a novel scheme for coupling the detector to a charge sensitive amplifier that should allow significant improvements in the signal-to-noise ratio in these high-capacitance devices. In addition, we will perform basic environmental tests to establish the suitability of this type of detector for use in spaceflight instruments.",Heliophysics Technology and Instrument Development for Science,TX08 - Sensors and Instruments,05/19/2020 07:08:36 PM,Extension of the dE/dx-E Technique Using Silicon Detectors to below 1 MeV/nucleon (https://techport.nasa.gov/view/95773),https://techport.nasa.gov/api/projects/95773,

Significance includes design of radiation shielding materials for manned NASA missions into deep space, where galactic cosmic rays pose a serious health hazard. Computer codes simulating nuclear transport through materials, with associated input databases of interaction cross sections, enable radiation risk assessment of shielding materials.

88677,Modeling Space Radiation with Bleomycin,"Space radiation is a mixed field of solar particle events (proton) and particles of Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCR) with different energy levels. These radiation events are difficult to model for Human Space Flight research.&nbsp; Currently bleomycin has been widely used as a radiomimetic agent and was often compared to low Linear Energy Transfer (LET) gamma radiation without defined characteristics. Our recent work suggests that bleomycin induces DNA damage and other cellular stresses resembling those resulted from mixed field radiation with both low and high LET particles. We hypothesize that bleomycin could be used to mimic space radiation in biological systems. Here I propose to further validate this concept with experiments outlined below. If confirmed, bleomycin can be used to treat biological specimen as an easily available model to study effects of space radiation on biological systems and to develop countermeasures for space radiation associated risks. During spaceflight, astronauts are exposed to space radiation which increases health risks in cancer development, degenerative tissues, immune systems, and others. Currently, most studies of radiation effects on human were based on single source radiation. In the contrast, space radiation consists of a mixture of protons from solar particle events, , heavy ions from galactic cosmic rays (GCR). There is no easily available method to model effects of space radiation on living organisms. While NASA Space Radiation Laboratory is working on advanced switches to make it possible to have a mixed field radiation with particles of different types and energies, the radiation source will be limited. The effects and outcomes of mixed field radiation are poorly understood due to this limitation. Development of an easily available experimental model for studying effects of mixed field radiation could greatly speed up our progress in understanding the molecular mechanisms of damages and responses from exposure to space radiation, and facilitate the discovery of protection and countermeasures against space radiation, which is critical for the mission to Mars. Recently, we demonstrated that bleomycin-induced DNA damage is of characteristics of those resulted from both low- and high-LET radiation in confluent human fibroblast. Published results showing that the same human fibroblast in confluency had different survival rate after exposure to low- or high-LET radiation. Bleomycin will be used to treat fibroblast under the same growth condition. Survival rates after treatment will be compared to the published results. It was also shown that some radiation countermeasures, e.g., the growth factor granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) are effective against mixed field radiation, but not others, e.g., the thrombopoietin (TPO) mimetic ALXN4100TPO. Effects of those radiation countermeasures against bleomycin treatment would be tested. These tests could provide further evidences for using bleomycin to model mixed field radiation exposure. This investigation will provide an experimental modeling method for studying effects of GCR and solar particle events. Bleomycin is easily obtained and can be used in cell culture and on animals to induce DNA damage and other cellular stresses. Bleomycin can be used at a low dose for long a long period of time to mimic what astronauts will experience in spaceflight. Candidates of radiation countermeasures could be screened using high-through-put screening technology with bleomycin treated cells. Thus, my proposed study could accelerate research and development to counter space radiation for the Mars mission. Once this investigation confirms my hypothesis. This modeling method could be used to study effects of mixed field radiation on different celllines or animals, to understand mechanism of molecular responses and actions, and to screen effective countermeasures that can be easily adapted for high-through-put screen using celllines. Thus, this investigation could greatly benefit NASA's mission on exploration of Mars.",Center Independent Research & Development: JSC IRAD,TX06.5.1 - Radiation Transport and Risk Modeling,10/10/2018 23:15,Modeling Space Radiation with Bleomycin (https://techport.nasa.gov/view/88677),https://techport.nasa.gov/api/projects/88677,
91026,A new system to quantify uncertainties in LEO satellite position determination due to space weather events,"We propose to develop a new system for quantitative assessment of uncertainties in LEO satellite position caused by storm time changes in space environmental parameters. The system will couple a unique and expanding collection of upper atmosphere models and Sun-to-Earth modeling chains available at the Community Coordinated Modeling Center (CCMC) with orbit determination algorithms utilized by the NASA/GSFC Flight Dynamics facility (FDF) and Conjunction Assessment Risk Analysis (CARA) group. The system will translate uncertainties in predicted atmospheric neutral density into differences between predicted and definitive orbits. This approach will address the lack of contemporary, high-resolution mass density and composition observational data and will utilize available definitive orbits as a ground truth for assessment of atmospheric neutral density modeling capabilities.&nbsp; The proposed effort is a game changing step towards quantitative assessment of state-of-the-art and building much needed NASA/GSFC in-house satellite drag prediction capabilities.&nbsp; The project will require multi-disciplinary collaboration among space environment domain experts, software engineers, and flight dynamics specialists.Atmospheric drag is one of the major space weather impacts on assets in space at altitudes up to 2000 km. Satellite drag severely impacts many aspects of NASA operations, including precision orbital determination (catalog, collision avoidance, reentry), space debris avoidance, fuel maintenance, lifetime estimates, attitude control system design, and spacecraft design.&nbsp; NASA/GSFC Flight Dynamics facility (FDF) and Conjunction Assessment Risk Analysis (CARA) group are relying on orbit errors provided by the Air Force Command using long-term averages and unknown methodology.&nbsp; Operational drag models are based on empirical models that use global solar and geomagnetic indices as input; however, uncertainties in current and predicted indices can lead to unacceptably large errors in orbit determinations. Most importantly, the uncertainties in orbit prediction during space weather events are not quantified, which makes accurate assessment of storm impact on conjunction events impossible.&nbsp; There is a clear call-to-action to quantify uncertainties in orbit predictions, to perform analysis aiming to advance understanding of storm impact on satellite drag, and to move towards improved satellite drag predictive capabilities during storm times. The CCMC hosts a unique, expanding collection of space environment models and Sun-to-Earth model chains, and leads community-wide efforts to assess space environment predictive capabilities including the ability to specify and forecast space-weather event impacts on atmospheric neutral density. The lack of contemporary, high-resolution mass density and composition observational data is a serious impediment for atmospheric density model-data comparisons and further model improvements. Therefore we need to implement an alternative metrics and validation approach appropriate for satellite drag applications that relies on available resources such as precise definitive orbits of LEO satellites. GSFC FDF maintains historical ephemeris records of the definitive orbit solutions for a broad range of altitudes as well as information about satellites orientation along the orbits that is required to evaluate drag coefficients. With this resource, we will use differences between definitive and predicted positions as a metrics for neutral density modeling capabilities and will translate uncertainties in predicted solar and geomagnetic indices and space environment parameters into quantitative uncertainties in orbit determinations. Space weather events trigger localized energy input from the magnetosphere that causes localized atmospheric density enhancements and strongly modify drag coefficients due to Joule heating and composition change, significantly affecting overpassing orbits. Empirical models driven by global indices typically miss such localized enhancements, while such features are captured by state-of-the-art physics-based models with realistic multi-scale dynamics. Although physics-based models offer a clear path to improved forecasting, they are currently underutilized for orbit propagation tools. We need to couple physics-based models with orbit propagators to: a) quantify the impact of storm-triggered density structures on satellite drag; b) analyze the sensitivity of satellite paths with respect to locations of increased density structures; c) evaluate and the potential of physics-based models to improve storm-time satellite drag modeling.The primary objective of this effort is to develop a system that will:translate uncertainties in predicted environmental parameters affecting satellite drag into uncertainties in orbit determinations;enable analysis of sensitivities to temporal and spatial variations of neutral density along satellite orbits and estimate uncertainties related to long-term averaging;establish metrics for atmosphere density specifications and forecasts based on deviations of predicted orbits from definitive orbits for different time windows;compare the value of different empirical and physics-based models that predict neutral densities for quantifying storm impacts on satellite drag; establish benchmarks, and enable tracing of improvements in predictive capabilities over time;&nbsp;identify new pathways for reducing uncertainties and enhancing satellite drag prediction capabilities.",Center Independent Research & Development: GSFC IRAD,TX06.5.4 - Space Weather Prediction,10/10/2018 23:15,A new system to quantify uncertainties in LEO satellite position determination due to space weather events (https://techport.nasa.gov/view/91026),https://techport.nasa.gov/api/projects/91026,
10175,"Control Suite and Teleoperator Interface for Whole-Body Mobile Manipulators, Phase I","Robots that can move about in terrestrial environments and manipulate large and small objects serve a critical role in NASA's Moon/Mars initiative. Such systems will need to serve as precursors to human missions, collaborate with humans on-site, and carry on when humans have departed. This proposal concerns a control suite and teleoperator interface for whole-body mobile manipulators (WBMMs). WBMMs are a class of redundant, mobile, multi-limbed platforms able to use their entire bodies for manipulation tasks. Such platforms are extremely versatile and can address NASA's need for platforms that perform useful work on the surface of the Moon or Mars. To exploit WBMM, a control framework capable of exploiting redundancy and new man-machine interfaces are required. digitROBOTICS and the Laboratory for Perceptual Robotics at UMass propose to build a WBMM control suite and teleoperator interface to address these challenges. We propose to use control basis framework developed at UMass over the past two decades and used to advance the state-of-the-art in many robotic task domains including grasping and manipulation. The WBMM control suite will simplify controller design and allows control knowledge to be easily ported between robots and operating contexts. The WBMM teleoperator interface will allow for varying levels of autonomy, and can preserve safety constraints using control mechanisms from the WBMM control suite. The anticipated result of the Phase 1 effort is preliminary software for controlling WBMMs as described above at TRL 4, and a proof of concept teleoperator interface at TRL 3. The anticipated result of a Phase 2 effort would be a commercial-grade version of both the control suite and teleoperator interface, and to have the control suite and teleoperator interface running on one of NASA's WBMMs (ATHLETE or Robonaut, for example). The results of the Phase 2 effort are estimated to be at TRL 5-6.",Small Business Innovation Research/Small Business Tech Transfer,TX10.2.4 - Execution and Control,10/10/2018 23:15,"Control Suite and Teleoperator Interface for Whole-Body Mobile Manipulators, Phase I (https://techport.nasa.gov/view/10175)",https://techport.nasa.gov/api/projects/10175,
8106,"TEPC Microdosimeter for LEO and Beyond, Phase I","A new generation of Tissue Equivalent Proportional Counters (TEPCs) for micro-dosimetric measurements will be designed, incorporating recent advances in the electronics industry and a new detector configuration. The unit is projected to be 2.5x4.5x1 in, weigh less than 8 oz, and consume less than 100 mW of power. A detector configuration of thirteen half-inch spheres arranged in a 2-D array will be used - twelve connected together to form an equivalent spherical 1.74-inch diameter detector for measuring low fluence environments, and the thirteenth detector connected independently allowing measurements during high fluence periods when the larger detector would saturate (such as during solar particle events). The new electronics will continuously convert the detector data at 1 Mhz. Digital methods will allow both the setting of any threshold and the determination of event peaks, and allow more sophisticated signal processing to be used to reduce noise and eliminate micro-phonics. In addition, a bi-processing method of analyzing the detector signals will allow determination of dose by both integration method and peak method which can then be analyzed to provide accurate total dose readings for the events from the threshold to below 0.05 keV/micron. The spectra below several kev/micron is important as it can contain up to 40% of the total dose. The detector filled with pure propane will simulate a 2 micron site size. Two spectra will be stored each minute, and total integrated dose, dose above threshold, dose equivalent dead-time will be provided every second. The spectra will have 2048 channels at 1 keV/micron for each channel, to a maximum of 2047 keV/micron. The threshold for peak detection and analysis can be set anywhere from 0.4 to 20 keV/micron. The unit will be capable of measurement ranging from less than 100 nGy/hr to over 100 mGy/hr.",Small Business Innovation Research/Small Business Tech Transfer,TX08.1.1 - Detectors and Focal Planes,10/10/2025 23:15,"TEPC Microdosimeter for LEO and Beyond, Phase I (https://techport.nasa.gov/view/8106)",https://techport.nasa.gov/api/projects/8106,
